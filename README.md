# GraphQL Recipe Box

## Motivation

I love cooking and finding new recipes but this tends to leave me with a lot of open tabs on my computer or recipes that get bookmarked and never seen again. I decided to create a website where I can save all my recipes in one place. I've also been dying to learn a lot of new technologies so this will be my playground to learn GraphQL, TypeScript, Jest, and React-Testing-Library!

## Features

-  Users can sign up and login
-  Users can favorite a recipe to add it to their collection
-  Users can browse all the recipes in the database
-  Users can create/upload their own recipes
-  Users can add tags to recipes to later filter them

## Installation

Installation and setup steps coming soon!
